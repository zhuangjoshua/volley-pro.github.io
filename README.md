VolleyPro Website README

I implemented two main interactive features to enhance user experience and accessibility:

1. Theme Switcher
2. Font Size Adjuster

Theme Switcher (Light/Dark Mode)

The theme switcher allows users to toggle between light and dark modes.

Expected behavior:
- Clicking the "Light Mode" button switches the site to a light color scheme.
- Clicking the "Dark Mode" button switches the site to a dark color scheme.
- The selected theme persists across page navigation and browser sessions.
- The theme switch affects background colors, text colors, and other UI elements for readability in different lighting conditions.

Font Size Adjuster

The font size adjuster allows users to increase or decrease the font size.

Expected behavior:
- Clicking the "A-" button decreases the font size (min: 12px).
- Clicking the "A+" button increases the font size (max: 24px).
- The font size change applies to all text content on the page.
- The selected font size persists across page navigation and browser sessions.
- Font size changes are incremental, changing by 2px with each click.

Notes: 
- A skip link is provided at the top of each page for keyboard users to skip to the main content.
